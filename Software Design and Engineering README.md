In my first enhancement on my chosen Artifact, I have shown improvements in my knowledge of software design and engineering. I thought a good way to do that would be to add a high score count to the game. I did this by adding another class that collects scores and high scores in a different way than I did before. This way I could have the scores being saved routinely by adding it to the steps / the algorithm of how the game over was processed once the player reached 0 health. I have this score being saved as an .xml file within the bin structure of the project files. The way I have it written it can save the top five high scores locally within that .xml file. I had to go into the game1.cs file and change out the old high score functions and calls with the newly created ones so that there wouldnâ€™t be as much conflict during the game process. You can see the code for the high scores in the Game1.cs and the ScoreManager.cs classes. This happens to bleed over into the second Artifact because of me creating the ScoreManager.cs class.
