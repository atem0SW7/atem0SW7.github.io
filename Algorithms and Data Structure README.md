I also used my Exploding Teddys game here to demonstrate my insight and skill with Algorithms and data structures. I took much of the code that is packed into certain classes together and created separate classes for them to make the code more expandable and scalable. Such as the high scores I mentioned for the Software Design and Engineering Category. I have taken that code out of game constants and created a class to better manage the way all of itâ€™s data structures are configured. I wanted my game to be able to be built upon and expanded in the future. I also wanted to make the Teddy Bears less predictable. Before they were too easy to predict and figure out but by changing the parameters of the Random Number Generator that the bears called for timing on when to appear and what speeds that they travel and fire, I was able to make the game a bit more challenging. Handling both of those allowed me to display that I have gained more insight in algorithms and data structures as well as having the ability to step back and look at the big picture and see what areas needed to be fixed.
